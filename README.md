# 🖼️ Image Resizer Tool

The goal is to automatically **resize and convert multiple images** using Python.


## 🚀 Features
- Resize all images in a folder automatically  
- Convert images to another format (PNG in this task)  
- Save the resized images into an output folder  
- Skip invalid or corrupted files using error handling  
- Beginner-friendly code  


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pillow (PIL)** – for image editing  
- **os module** – for reading folders and file handling

## 🧠 What I Learned from This Task

During this task, I learned:

- ✔ How to use the **Pillow (PIL)** library to open, resize, and save images  
- ✔ How to read all files in a folder using the **os module**  
- ✔ How to handle errors using **try–except**  
- ✔ How image conversion works (e.g., JPG → PNG)  
- ✔ What pixels are and how images are made of tiny dots  
- ✔ How to automate repetitive tasks using Python  
- ✔ How to create a clean, organized project structure  
- ✔ How to prepare a GitHub-ready project (README + code)  

This task helped me understand image processing, automation, Python modules, and file handling in a practical and simple way.


## 📦 Future Improvements 
- Add user input for custom image size  
- Add option to choose output image format  
- Build a GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt  
- Add progress bars for large batches
